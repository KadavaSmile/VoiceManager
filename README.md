# VoiceManager <img src="https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Smer4k/VoiceManager/total?style=for-the-badge&logo=github" alt="Downloads">

Allows you to create group chats or give Proximity Chat to Scp.

## Requirements

- HintServiceMeow [v5.4.4](https://github.com/MeowServer/HintServiceMeow/releases/tag/V5.4.4)

## Features

- **Group chats**
  - You can add any player to the group regardless of role (even if it is SCP)
  - A player can be a member of several groups
  - A player can mute a group he is a member of
  - May be issued temporarily until first death
  - It can also display a list of members of the current group on the screen.

- **Proximity chat**
  - Available only to SCP
  - Removed upon death or when the player is no longer an SCP
  - There are two options: 3D, which uses SpeakerToy with reverb, and 2D without it, but there will be a player bar on the right (You can configure it in the config or via the in-game command).

The plugin has a **settings** command that allows you to change some variables in real time without restarting the server, but all changes are reset to the values â€‹â€‹from the config after restarting the server.

I recommend going into the **configs** to enable/disable what you need.

All text on the screen (hints) as well as in Server-specific can be changed in the **translation.yml**.

## Extra info

This plugin tries to be as customisable as possible, but possibly has flaws for it's initial versions. If you have any issues please make a GitHub issue. (Please, no slang or abbreviations, my English level is not the highest. Sorry ðŸ˜¥)

## Developers

Hi developers!

This plugin has events, I hope they will help your plugins.

Maybe this plugin has a lot of garbage or something like that. So if you want to help improve the plugin, I will be glad, but I do not force anyone to do it.

I wish everyone a good day and mood! :Ð·
